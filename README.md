# Albedo Recovery for Aerial Photogrammetric Images

This repository contains the upcoming implementation of the albedo recovery approach described in the paper: [A general albedo recovery approach for aerial photogrammetric images through inverse rendering](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1jlhp3I9x1qnxt).

Thank you for your interest in our work. We look forward to sharing our tools and seeing the amazing results you achieve with them!
